_School Group Project_

**ToolMate** is a React web app that is meant to allow UTD students to find the best software tools for their classes. Many classes have outdated or no software tool reccomendations, and in many cases, these tools don't work for all operating systems. In addition, there may be course specific information like shortcuts, tools, and more. ToolMate gives a place for current and previous students to voice their opinion on user-submitted software tools. Students can post new software tools, comment on submissions, and upvote/downvote both tools and comments. The days of using Eclipse just because your professor said so are long over, long live IntelliJ.
