_Personal Project_

**This portfolio website** is a showcase of my work and experience in a fun visually appealing, responsive UI. It uses **Astro** and **Vue.js** behind the scenes.

## 💡 Technologies used

- Astro
- Vue.js
- HTML5
- JavaScript

## 🌐 Demo

## 🎯 Objective

This was made to have a place to show my work, but it was also primary a way to practice my Vue skills, my UI designing skills, and to learn Astro. Howver, most of the website uses vue, and only uses Astro to handle routing and markdown file collections.
