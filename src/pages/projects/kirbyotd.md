_Personal Project_

**KirbyOTD** is a fullstack React/Express.js web app that shows a new Kirby copy ability transformation each day. It provides means to see previous days' Kirbys, and it shows a fun countdown until the next copy ability. It also intelligently cycles through copy abilities until all of them have been seen before resetting.

Developed with **React, Express.js, and PostgreSQL**

## 🎯 Objective

The purpose of KirbyOTD was to learn how to make an API using Express.js along with practicing SQL skills before taking Database Systems. The idea came from when I was in Calculus II, and I would draw a new Kirby each day to place in my notes. Eventually, I thought that actually generating a random Kirby would make the process more fun.
